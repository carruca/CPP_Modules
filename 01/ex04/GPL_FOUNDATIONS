Nobody should be restricted by the software they use.
There are four freedoms that every user should have:

The freedom to use the software for any purpose,
The freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
The freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
The freedom to share the changes you make.

When a program offers users all of these freedoms, we call it free software.
